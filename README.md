# Invariant EEG Representation Learning via Adversarial Inference

This is the invariant EEG representation learning convolutional neural network (CNN) implementation, which uses an adversarial training scheme to monitor and/or censor nuisance-specific leakage in learned representations. The aim is to perform adversarial censoring during the CNN training procedure such that the network can learn nuisance-invariant representations within the discriminative CNN setting. Implementation is in Python using Keras with the Tensorflow backend.
